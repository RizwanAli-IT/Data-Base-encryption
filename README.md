# Data-Base-encryption

This Flask web application implements secure user registration with form validation, encrypted data storage, and avatar uploads. It checks for existing usernames, emails, and phone numbers in a MySQL database. The app validates user input, ensuring correct formats for usernames, emails, passwords, and more. Passwords are securely hashed using encryption, enhancing data protection. Users can upload avatars, which are processed and stored securely. This solution ensures both user convenience and robust security through encryption and validation techniques.
